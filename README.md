This repository shows a workflow of decomposing yield gaps into different component in a spatially differentiated manner. We are also to explain the factors that affect risk in addition to yield and yield gaps. We rely on a Bayesian geoadditive efficiency model of location and scale by Klein et al (2020).
The workflow can be accessed here: https://maxwellmkondiwa.github.io/Spatial_yield_gap_decomposition_tool/
